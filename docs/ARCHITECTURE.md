# Architecture

For the Unicode/CLDR platform architecture (text algorithms, formatters, and the
CLDR data pipeline), see the `i18n` crate's docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

`messages` is an ICU-style message-formatting engine built on the i18n platform.
The release architecture has one application-facing production path:

```text
text catalog -> deterministic catalog validation -> locale/key lookup -> public ICU evaluation -> public render result
```

Initialization is the only operation allowed to read text catalog files and
populate public catalog state. Catalog entries retain normalized locale/key/source
identity for deterministic lookup. Public rendering resolves a catalog entry by
locale/key fallback and evaluates the stored source through the public catalog
render path. Internal regression paths exercise parser, validator, compiler,
cache, and fixed-buffer execution components for internal invariants, but public
callers never receive parser objects, compiled handles, cache objects, or buffer
internals.

## Runtime structure

```text
Messages.Runtime.Instance
  catalog entries: normalized locale + key + source identity
  default locale
  initialization validity state
  compatibility single-message state for regression tests

Parser -> Validator -> Compiler -> Compiled Message / Cache
                                         |
                                         v
                                Execution Engine
                                         |
                                         v
                               Messages.Result.Render_Result
```

The source tree contains private compatibility entry points and white-box test
packages. They exist to preserve regression coverage and semantic continuity.
They are not part of the application-facing 0.1.0 compatibility contract.

## Public/internal boundary

Public packages:

* `Messages`
* `Messages.Runtime`
* `Messages.Result`
* `Messages.Diagnostics`
* `Messages.Arguments`
* `I18N.Locales` (platform dependency, for locale canonicalization/fallback)
* `I18N.Plurals` (platform dependency, for CLDR plural categories)

Internal or compatibility-only packages:

* parser and AST packages
* validation packages
* compiler and compiled-message packages
* cache packages
* buffer and fast-render packages
* lower-level renderer packages
* fuzz/corpus harness packages

Application examples for the frozen API must compile without importing internal
packages.

## Data ownership

The runtime owns catalog metadata and initialization validity state. Catalog
entries are lookup records containing normalized locale/key/source data, not
public compiled-message handles. Public render calls accept a limited argument
map and do not expose ownership of internal parser, cache, or compiled
structures. Locale-sensitive formatting delegates to the i18n platform
formatters and its generated `I18N.CLDR_Data` data layer; the message engine
does not own CLDR data.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics are optional and observational. Enabling callbacks or storing
diagnostic detail must not change message selection, output text, result status,
cache contents, runtime contents, or IR contents. Callback exceptions are
contained.

## Release cleanup rule

No application-facing release feature may require parser cursors, cache maps, IR
arrays, VM/codegen experiments, prototype packages, or non-public AST execution
paths. Those may remain only when needed as implementation details or
regression-test support, and they must stay out of public examples and 0.1.0
documentation examples.

## Release verification boundary

The release boundary is verified by the project-tools-based `check_messages`
guard launched by `alr test`: the core library build, test project build, AUnit
runner, example project build and output checks, CLDR data-boundary checks,
Alire build/test checks, render benchmark smoke checks, GNATdoc, and GNATprove
must pass for the intended release channel.
