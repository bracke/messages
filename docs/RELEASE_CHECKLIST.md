# Release Checklist

A v0.1.0 release candidate is acceptable only when the mandatory items below are true for the candidate being published.

## Build and tests

```text
[verified] alr test succeeds
```

`alr test` must route through the `check_messages` guard, which uses the sibling
`project_tools` crate for release checks and runs the library build, test build,
AUnit runner, examples build and output checks, CLDR data-boundary checks,
Alire build/test checks, benchmark smoke checks for render hot paths and
bounded `Render_Into`, GNATdoc, and GNATprove.

## Alire publication readiness audit

```text
[verified] check_messages Alire publication readiness audit succeeds
```

The audit must confirm that the root `alire.toml` is pin-free, named `messages`,
declares publication metadata, publishes only `messages.gpr` as the primary project
file, declares the supported GNAT dependency, and routes the Alire test action
through the project-tools-based guard.

## Public API

* Public examples import only public packages.
* Public result statuses match `docs/ERROR_MODEL.md`.
* Public catalog behavior matches `docs/CATALOG_FORMAT.md`.
* No public example imports parser, AST, validation, compiler, compiled IR, cache, buffer, fast-render, lower-level renderer, formatter implementation, or generated CLDR data packages.

## Documentation

* `README.md` describes only implemented behavior.
* `docs/API.md` names the stable public API and marks compatibility-only APIs clearly.
* `docs/ICU_SUBSET.md` matches parser/validator tests.
* `docs/CATALOG_FORMAT.md` matches catalog tests.
* `docs/THREADING.md` distinguishes public render from the no-allocation compatibility `Render_Into` path.
* `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` states the source/runtime compatibility boundary.
* `docs/RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md` states the project-tools-based verification guard and private-package acceptance rules.
* `docs/SPARK.md` states the SPARK-enabled units and GNATprove release command.

## Cleanup

* No abandoned prototype package is presented as public API.
* No non-public AST execution path is presented as the production application path.

## Release blocker

Do not tag v0.1.0 from documentation review alone. Before public publication, run `alr test` and require the project-tools-based `check_messages` guard, including example output checks, CLDR data-boundary checks, benchmark smoke checks, GNATdoc, and GNATprove, to pass for the candidate being published.

## Ada discriminant-safety audit

The public and internal result models use non-discriminated storage. `Messages.Result.Render_Result`, `Messages.Result.Output_View`, and `Messages.Errors.Result` may be default-created without relying on discriminated string bounds, and the verified build no longer emits the GNAT `Storage_Error` warning previously associated with default result creation.

For future maintenance:

- Do not reintroduce discriminated string fields into public or internal render-result records.
- Keep rendered text behind bounded storage or an explicitly managed string container.
- Re-run the Ada keyword and discriminant-safety audits after changing result types.
- Treat any new GNAT warning about object creation possibly raising `Storage_Error` as a release blocker.

## GNATdoc specification comments

Before release, every `.ads` subprogram declaration must have GNATdoc-style comments immediately documenting each formal parameter with `@param` and each function result with `@return`. This pass has been applied to public, private/internal, example-support, and test specifications.
